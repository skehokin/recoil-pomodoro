- Recoil is still labelled as "experimental", and there are a number of utils and functionality which are usable - in theory - but flagged as unstable.
I find this mildly worrying to use in a production app.

- Since it's relatively new - from 2020/2021, I didn't find stack overflow to be too helpful with specific bugs.

- Recoil seems well-suited for domain-driven architecture.

- My experience has been that recoil is probably better with an external database. Without a db, it's frustrating to manage the id separately from the rest of the data.

- People's experience seems to be that Recoil is not the best tool to use for async data fetching, and I'd be hesitant to combine it with React Query.
